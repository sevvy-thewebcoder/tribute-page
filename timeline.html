                  Steve was 13 yrs old, when he was given a summer job by Bill
                  Hewlett (of Hewlett-Packard) after Steve cold-called him to
                  ask for parts for an electronics project.

                <p>
                  In the same year, Steve began his first year study at

                  After just one semester, Steve dropped out of Reed College
                  without telling his parents. Steve later explained that he
                  decided to drop out because he did not want to spend his
                  parents' money on an education that seemed meaningless to
                  him.

                  was widely acclaimed by the media with strong initial sales
